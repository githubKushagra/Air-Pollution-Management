		</div>

		<p>
		<h2 style="font-size:40px;color: red;">INTRODUCTION</h2>
		<h2>Air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental issues facing our planet today.
			It refers to the presence of harmful substances in the air, such as gases, particles, and biological
			molecules, that can affect the health of living organisms and the environment. The sources of air pollution
			are numerous and can come from both natural and human activities.
			<br>Air pollution is a significant problem in many parts of the world, particularly in developing countries.
			In some cities, air pollution levels are so high that they pose an immediate threat to human health,
			causing respiratory problems and other illnesses. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air
			pollution is responsible for over 7 million premature deaths worldwide each year, making it the single
			largest environmental health risk.
			<br><br><br>The primary sources of air pollution are transportation, industry, power generation, and
			agriculture.
			Vehicle exhaust is a significant contributor to air pollution in urban areas, releasing harmful gases
			such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter into the air. Industrial activities
			such as mining, manufacturing, and construction can also release significant amounts of air pollutants
			into the environment. Power generation from fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, is another
			major contributor to air pollution. The burning of these fuels releases pollutants such as sulfur dioxide,
			nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter into the air. Finally, agriculture also plays a role in air
			pollution,
			as the use of fertilizers and pesticides can release harmful gases into the environment.
			<br><br>
			<br>Air pollution can have significant health impacts, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases,
			cancer, and neurological effects. Exposure to high levels of air pollution can cause or worsen conditions
			such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer. Air pollution can also harm
			the cardiovascular system, leading to increased risk of heart attack and stroke. In addition, air pollution
			has been linked to neurological effects, including cognitive decline and dementia.<br>
			<br>
			<br>Air pollution can also harm ecosystems by damaging crops and forests, acidifying soil and water, and
			contributing to climate change. High levels of air pollution can damage crops by reducing photosynthesis,
			stunting growth, and reducing yields. Forests can also be affected by air pollution, leading to the decline
			of tree species and reduced biodiversity. Air pollution can also contribute to climate change by releasing
			greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.
			<br>
			<br>Addressing air pollution requires a range of solutions, including policy and regulation, technological
			innovation, and public awareness campaigns. Governments can regulate emissions from vehicles, industries,
			and power plants, as well as promote the use of cleaner fuels and renewable energy sources. Technological
			innovation can also play a role in reducing air pollution, such as the development of cleaner engines and
			more efficient energy production. Finally, public awareness campaigns can help educate people about the
			impacts
			of air pollution and encourage them to take action to reduce their own emissions.


			<br>
			<br>In conclusion, air pollution is a significant environmental issue that has far-reaching impacts on
			human health and the environment. The sources of air pollution are numerous and varied, and addressing
			the problem requires a range of solutions. By working together to reduce air pollution, we can improve
			the health of our planet and ensure a more sustainable future for all.

		<br>
		<h1 style="font-size:40px;color: red;">Causes of air pollution</h1>
		<br>
		<p style="font-size:25px">Air pollution is caused by a variety of natural and human-made factors.
			Some of the main causes of air pollution include:</p>
		<p style="font-size:20px;color: green;">1.Transportation:</p>
		<h2>Air pollution caused by transportation refers to the release of harmful substances into the air
			from vehicles such as cars, trucks, buses, and airplanes. The primary pollutants released by
			transportation are nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), and
			volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These pollutants are harmful to both human health and the
			environment.<br><br>
			NOx is a major pollutant emitted by transportation, particularly diesel-powered vehicles. NOx contributes
			to the formation of smog and can have serious health impacts, including respiratory problems and
			cardiovascular disease. CO is another pollutant emitted by transportation, particularly in urban areas
			with heavy traffic. CO can reduce the amount of oxygen in the blood, leading to headaches, dizziness,
			and nausea.</h2>

		<br>

		<p style="font-size:20px;color: green;">2.Industrial activities:</p>
		<h2>Industrial activities are a significant source of air pollution, releasing a range of pollutants
			into the environment. Industries such as manufacturing, mining, and construction can release harmful
			substances into the air, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter.
			These pollutants are often generated as a byproduct of the production process or the use of heavy machinery.

			alt="Pollution caused by Industries" width="1000" height="300">

		<br>

		<p style="font-size:20px;color: green;">3.Agricultural activities:</p>
		<h2>Agriculture is a significant contributor to air pollution. The use of fertilizers and pesticides
			in agriculture can release harmful gases into the environment, such as ammonia and nitrogen oxides.
			Ammonia is produced when fertilizers containing nitrogen are applied to the soil, while nitrogen
			oxides are released during the cultivation of crops and the use of heavy machinery such as tractors.</h2>
